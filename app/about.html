			<h4>is an inventory checklist app that helps grocery stores donate food to soup kitchens</h2>

			<p>Problem: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/why-grocery-stores-throw-out-so-much-food-2014-10" target="_blank">10% of Grocery Store non-expired, edible food stock</a> in America is thrown away each year. Thats over 13 billion pounds of food. Most of this food is good for a much longer time frame.  Grocery stores have few ways to keep track of their perishable and non-perishable foods. These stores throw out 10% of the food that they have because they do not have an effective tracking system for inventory on the shelf.</p>  

			<p>We built an inventory system that lets them manage their goods and keep track of the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-sell-by-date-means-on-food-packages-2013-9" target="_blank">expiration and Sell By dates.</a> So that they can donate or sell unwanted food.</p>

			<p>Our system lets stores donate food that they no longer plan to keep, or sell it at a low cost to a local soup kitchen (or food bank) by posting it on our soup kitchen packages page. </p>

			<p>This resolves issues with food being thrown out way before the food is indeed bad and give millions of people access to fresh food. It also gives companies a means to easily donate foods to soup kitchens and reap the tax benefits. </p>
