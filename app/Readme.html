Secondary Heading: Inventory checklist app that helps grocery stores donate food to soup kitchens

Problem: 10% of Grocery Store non-expired, edible food stock in America is thrown away each year. Most of it is good for a much longer time frame. 

Grocery stores have few ways to keep track of their perishable and non-perishable foods. Stores throw out 10% of the food they stock in their stores way before it is actually bad to eat. 

We built an inventory system that lets them manage their goods and keep track of the expiration dates. So that they can donate unwanted food. 

Our system lets stores donate food that they no longer plan to sell, or sell it at a low cost to a local soup kitchen by posting it on our soup kitchen packages page. 

This resolves issues with almost expired food being thrown out way before the food is indeed bad. It gives companies a means to easily donate foods to soup kitchens and reap the tax benefits.
